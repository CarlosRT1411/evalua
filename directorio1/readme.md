# Setting up a repository
## git init / git clone / git config

This tutorial provides an overview of how to set up a repository (repo) under Git version control. This resource will walk you through initializing a Git repository for a new or existing project. Included below are workflow examples of repositories both created locally and cloned from remote repositories. This guide assumes a basic familiarity with a command-line interface.

*The high level points this guide will cover are:*

- Initializing a new Git repo
- Cloning an existing Git repo
- Committing a modified version of a file to the repo
- Configuring a Git repo for remote collaboration
- Common Git version control commands

By the end of this module, you should be able to create a Git repo, use common Git commands, commit a modified file, view your project’s history and configure a connection to a Git hosting service (Bitbucket).

## What is a Git repository? 

A [Git repository](https://bitbucket.org/product/code-repository) **is a virtual storage** of your project. It allows you to save versions of your code, which you can accesswhen needed.

## Initializing a new repository: git init

To create a new repo, you'll use the git init command. git init is a one-time command you use during the initial setup of a new repo. Executing this command will create a new .git subdirectory in your current working directory. This will also create a new main branch.

## Versioning an existing project with a new git repository

This example assumes you already have an existing project folder that you would like to create a repo within. You'll first cd to the root project folder and then execute the git init command.
